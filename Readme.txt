In this project i made a really basic website according to my possible users.
Firstly i shared this website with my roommates and, they did'nt care much actually but
they said it was good enough for a first timer. I made a simple slide for presentation
and my preperation process was already ended.

I made this website alone because i finished this project just a day before deadline,
and others already finished their project and i did'nt want to do nothing 
by myself. I hope you can understand it.

Subject of this website is just give some entertaining time for people who is bored in
their home, especially after the corona incident, this kind of website came to my mind.
With this site user can listen some random songs on the internet and play a simple geography
game on their browser. It is really entertaining if you try it.
